abstract = {AdaptiveResonance.jl is a Julia package for machine learning with Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) algorithms, written in the numerical computing language Julia. ART is a neurocognitive theory of how competitive cellular networks can learn distributed patterns without supervision through recurrent field connections, eliciting the mechanisms of perception, expectation, and recognition (Grossberg, 1980, 2013).},
