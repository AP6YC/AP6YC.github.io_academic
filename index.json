Though this site is meant to serve as my personal homepage, I wanted to briefly talk about some of the guiding principles of why I - or indeed \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo;, the scientists and engineers of the world - do what I/we do, which I hope to convince you does indeed overlap with the meaning of the funny name that I have chosen for my website.\nSemantics The Attic Greek work \u0026ldquo;λόγος\u0026rdquo; generally derives from the infinitive \u0026ldquo;λέω\u0026rdquo; (to speak) via the first person present indefinite \u0026ldquo;λέγω\u0026rdquo; (I speak), cognate of the Latin \u0026ldquo;legō, legere, lēgī lēctum\u0026rdquo; (to read/explain). The term \u0026ldquo;λέω\u0026rdquo; generally refers to the act of speaking with purpose, in the sense of discussion, clarification, or even debate. While the related \u0026ldquo;λέξις\u0026rdquo; would typically be used in the literal sense of \u0026ldquo;word\u0026rdquo;, the term \u0026ldquo;λόγος\u0026rdquo; was used in the sense of rhetoric, and hense it has its origins in ancient Greek philosophy to mean anything from \u0026ldquo;argument\u0026rdquo; the reason to \u0026ldquo;argument\u0026rdquo; the discourse.\nUsage The term began to be used in a multitude of ways by different schools of thought from the Stoics to the variety of churches in the common era. Early rhetoricians used the term \u0026ldquo;λόγος\u0026rdquo; in the sense of pursuasion by reason. The early Stoics with their plethora of uniquely articulated tenets used the term to refer to the structured foundation of the universe, \u0026ldquo;λόγος σπερματικός.\u0026rdquo; Religious philosophers appropriated this sense to mean the divine declaration of order and hense the very breath that created the universe, going so far as to assert the motion of the entire world is the divine λόγος, the \u0026ldquo;word of God.\u0026rdquo; Later usage is increasingly varied, but the sense of \u0026ldquo;structure\u0026rdquo; provides a throughline, from that of the structure of reason to the creation of the cosmos and the laws that give it order.\nIs this arrant pedantry? The purpose of this post is not to show off my capacity for esoteric sophistry, though I admit to letting myself fall down linguistic rabbit holes more than my graduate time schedule should permit. I first became aware of the term through my own personal journey with Stoicism in the modern world, but as I learned about it I found that its amalgam meaning captured my personal philosophy about the reason that I am in the sciences to begin with. Beyond a semantic curiosity, the reason that this site is titled \u0026ldquo;λόγος\u0026rdquo; is because I wanted to unify the purpose of why I post here or indeed do anything at all.\nSoapbox As a scientist and engineer, I share a curiosity with much of the world about the nature of the universe that we are born into. We are all of us thrust into an ambiguous, confusing, and seemingly chaotic mess of a world, the realization of which is not aided by the fact that we are burdened with the knowledge of how fleeting our time in it is. And yet, despite the crushing gravity of knowing our cosmic insignificance, transient eddies on a floating mot of dust in an imaginable expanse that we are, the human curiosity persists. Epistomologically, there is something magical about the fact that we are capable of learning, exploring, and finding answers whatsoever in the crazy world that we live in.\nConclusion Our capacity as humans to be aware of the world and our place in it is both the sickness and the cure; our lonely existential crisis can only be ameliorated by the pursuit of knowledge in understanding our place in the world. From the structure of the fabric of the universe to the inner workings of our very minds, the λόγος within and without, I believe that the pursuit of knowledge is not just the only thing to do that makes sense in this life but is also the very thing that bestows upon it meaning.\nThat, and being good to one another, of course.\n","date":1564358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632787200,"objectID":"27bd52d7d0b1367a426332e3e5c37ead","permalink":"https://ap6yc.github.io/post/2019-07-29-logos/","publishdate":"2019-07-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-07-29-logos/","section":"post","summary":"A foundational philosophy of inquiry and curiosity.","tags":["philosophy"],"title":"λόγος","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
