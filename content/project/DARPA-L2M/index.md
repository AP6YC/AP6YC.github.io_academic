The Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T) participated in the first phase of the [DARPA Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M)](https://www.darpa.mil/program/lifelong-learning-machines) program as a seedling organization.
Since then, I have participated in the program by securing S&T as a subcontractor under Teledyne Scientific in the second phase.
